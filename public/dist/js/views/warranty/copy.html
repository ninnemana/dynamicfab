	<p><strong>Limitation on Warranty</strong></p>

	<p>Alterations to or misuse of the Product will void the warranty. For example, overloading or exceeding an automobile or trailer manufacturers&rsquo; weight ratings, or maneuvering motor vehicles equipped with Products at improper rate of speed, shall void the warranty on any of the Products. Failure to properly maintain and regularly inspect the Product according to the specific instruction sheet accompanying each Product shall also void the warranty.</p>
	<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages. If such exclusions or limitations are prohibited under the applicable law, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply.</p>
	<p>This Warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other rights, which vary from state to state.</p>
	<p>The Purchaser, when returning a CURT Product, must observe the following steps:</p>
